# CE C4D MS cartridge
#### _A 3D-printed cartridge developed to improve the interface between a capillary electrophoresis instrument and a mass spectrometer._
The cartridge was developed to be used with a capillary electrophoresis (CE) instrument from Agilent (model CE7100) and a mass spectrometer from the same manufacturer (model 6430). However, the __IPT files__ can be modified for other combination of instruments using [Inventor](https://www.autodesk.com.br/products/inventor/overview). If this is not the case, you can use the __STL files__ and your 3D printer.

There are two versions: the basic CE-MS cartridge and the CE-C4D-MS cartridge, in which up two capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detectors (C4Ds) can be used. We have some papers if you wish to learn more about our CE-C4D and the combination CE-C4D-MS [1-7]:
